[xBR](https://forums.libretro.com/t/xbr-algorithm-tutorial/123) is a pixel art scaling algorithm originally by Hyllian. Since then, there have been many implementations. I have referenced others' work and transposed these algorithms into Lua, as well as tied into the [Aseprite Scripting API](https://github.com/aseprite/api). I am truly standing on the shoulders of giants for this extension.
